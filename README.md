# Traffic-Management-System
This a Traffic Management system using ultrasonic sensor. 

Summary of Working:
The sensors pick up signals at the junction.  
This signals are given to the board to deicde whether there is a car in front of it or not. 
Different sensors indicate diffrent level of traffic density. The more sensors detect object, the more the traffic density is. 
The board then accordingly delays/speeds up the time duration of the green signal for the respective road.
